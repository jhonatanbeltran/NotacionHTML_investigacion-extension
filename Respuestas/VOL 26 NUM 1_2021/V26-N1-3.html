                    The wireless networks supported in the 802.11 standard play an important role in the field of connectivity,
                    due to the benefits related to mobility, availability, speed and low cost of implementation. This study aims 
                    to experimentally find the factors that affect the performance of a WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider) 
                    based on the 802.11 standard. In the proposed scenario, the behavior of the Throughput and delays in the 
                    transmission processes were analyzed based on factors such as frequency, distance and the number of stations 
                    connected to the Access point under study. In the results obtained, it was possible to demonstrate the levels 
                    of influence that the factors mentioned above reflected in relation to the performance of the link and the 
                    available bandwidth. The proposed model can be considered as an excellent tool for the analysis of future works 
                    related to the design of WISP.

                    Las  redes  inalámbricas  soportadas  en  el  estándar  802.11  juegan  un  papel  importante  en  el  ámbito  
                    de  la  conectividad, debido a los beneficios relacionados con la movilidad, disponibilidad, velocidad y bajo

                    escenario propuesto se analizó el comportamiento del Throughput y retardos en los procesos de transmisión en función 
                    de factores tales como la frecuencia, la distancia y el número de estaciones conectadas al Access point objeto de 
                    estudio. En los resultados obtenidos se logró evidenciar los niveles de influencia que los factores mencionados

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
                
        <p>
            The transfer of data in large volumes and reliable connections over time became a necessity that experts in this field have had to meet. 
            Large companies, institutions of different kinds, organizations and others, allocate many of their resources (human, economic, technological, 
            etc.) to the research that leads to the development of high performance and capacity technologies <a href="#r1">[1]</a>. Wireless networks with 802.11 protocol 
            went from being an alternative solution in areas of difficult access where wired-type technologies were unfeasible due to their complexity, to 
            be an option that provides solutions in different environments, with the highest standards of quality and reliability thanks to the constant 
            evolution that it presents <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.

        </p>

        <p>
            Wireless networks play an important role in the field of connectivity, due to the benefits related to mobility, availability, speed and low cost
            of implementation <a href="#r3">[3]</a>. These types of networks are mainly made up of the use of concentrating devices called Access Point (AP), which allow users 
            to connect wirelessly within a limited area, which is why the proliferation of AP is increasing due to the need for more connection coverage. 

        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, two unlicensed frequency spectrum bands are available for use in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard: 2.4 GHz assigned to the ISM (Industrial 
            Scientific Medical) and 5GHz bands corresponding to the U-NII (Unlicensed National bands) Information Infrastructure). While the IEEE 
            802.11b / g standard operates in the 2.4 GHz band, the IEEE 802.11a standard makes use of the 5 GHz band. The number of available channels may vary 
            from one country to another due to the regulations of each in relation to the assignment of the radio spectrum <a href="#r4">[4]</a>. Additionally, the IEEE 802.11 
            specifies a spectral mask that defines the permitted distribution of energy through each channel.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Colombia, the last decade has been characterized by a massive expansion of 802.11 in both simple home or office applications  with  low  
            transmission  levels  and  indoor  environments,  as  well  as  in  large  business  applications  with  MAN or WAN type network infrastructure 
            in mixed environments (indoor and / or outdoor) that require transmitting different types of traffic with capacities up to the order of Gbps and 
            without any errors and cuts in communication <a href="#r5">[5]</a>.  The evolution in telecommunications in our country is supported by the need for massification 
            of the Internet as a tool for social and economic development in all sectors; being the Live Digital Plan a government flag project whose main 
            objective is the reduction of unemployment, poverty reduction and increase in global competitiveness.
        </p>

        <p>
            Due to the increase in the density of APs in WLAN networks, problems related to their performance have been found, which may be the result of lack 
            of policies for user management, about traffic load in AP, inadequate selection of frequencies between channels, electromagnetic interference, among 
            other aspects; generating that the APs are not able to attend the required volumes of traffic in an adequate way in order to offer adequate levels 
            of QoS (Quality of Service) to the users who need to make use of this service <a href="#r6">[6]</a>.  In this scenario, WLAN networks are unable to harness their full 
            potential. However, the incorporation of policies for intelligent management of radio resources RRM (Radio Resource Management), could be applied to 
            minimize the harmful effects of interference and a non-uniform load distribution, according to studies conducted by Arunesh Mishra, Hector Velayos <a href="#r7">[7]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This  article  seeks  to  analyze  the  behavior  of  a WISP  network  with  a  previously  operational  infrastructure  and generate an empirical 
            model that evaluates the performance of this type of networks, evaluating parameters such as Throughput and Transmission Delay of communication 
            between stations. and the Access Point, whose data is collected experimentally by injecting random data.

        <p class="titulo">Methodology </p>

        <p>
            A fundamental aspect in the design of experiments is to decide which tests or treatments are going to be executed in the process and the amount of 
            repetitions of each one, so that the maximum information is obtained at the minimum cost on the object of study. The arrangement constituted by the 
            different process conditions that will be executed, including the repetitions is called the “design matrix” <a href="#r8">[8]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            An experimental design is more than a set of test conditions: it is a sequence of stages or activities that must be performed to successfully achieve 
            the objectives pursued. Currently, there are several types of experimental designs where each of them allows to study situations that occur in practical 
            life, adjusting to the needs of the researcher. It is very important to know how to choose the most suitable for the problem you want to solve <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="titulo">Parameters of interest to evaluate the performance of a network</p>

        <p>
            In any type of networks and especially in wireless networks (due to their sensitivity in the transmission medium) it is very important to know the 
            quality of communication. For this it is necessary to make an analysis of the network and thus determine its performance. In the present study, basic 
            factors such as: Throughput and delay will be taken into account.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughput: It is the most relevant parameter when analyzing the performance of a data network. It is defined as the relationship between useful 
            information and the transmission time of the communication <a href="#r10">[10]</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">The mathematical expression is given by:</p>

            <i>Delay:</i> The delay obtained is calculated as the average of the differences between the shipping and receiving times of the packages. For the purposes 
            of sampling, the value of “Standard Deviation of Delay” (σ) is taken which is calculated according to the following expression <a href="#r11">[11]</a>:

        <p>
            The experimental design selected is of the factorial type, whose objective is to study the effect of several factors on one or several responses. 
            That is, what is sought is to study the relationship between the factors and the response, in order to know better how this relationship is and 
            generate knowledge that allows actions and decisions to be taken that improve the performance of the process. To identify the way in which each 
            factor influences the variable of interest, it is necessary to choose at least two test levels for each of them. With the complete factorial 
            design, all possible combinations that can be formed with the selected levels are randomly run in the process <a href="#r12">[12]</a>.  In the end, it is expected 
            to define the influence that one or more input factors have on the output or response variable, looking for tools that represent important 
            information and allow to evaluate the performance of a WISP wireless network.

        <p class="titulo">Experiment Description</p>

        <p>
            Currently in the market of computer networks there are different kinds of software such as: IPERF, DITG, MGEN, among others, which provide the 
            possibility of generating artificial traffic, simulating the behavior of certain types of data; however, for the present project it was decided to 
            make measurements with real traffic generated from a server (located in the distribution node), where a file was housed to perform the respective 
            download tests with limited speed only by the capacity of the channel or medium of transmission (wireless medium).
        </p>

        <p>
            To establish an infrastructure-type wireless communication between two terminals, at least one device that acts as an access point and the 
            corresponding terminals is required. In the case of study, the infrastructure described in Figure 4 is available to perform the respective tests 
            and measurements <a href="#r13">[13]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The experiment consists of connecting a UBIQUITI brand CPE type wireless test device, model NM2 or NM5 to the existing UBIQUITI brand access 
            points, model ROCKET M2 or M5, at a certain distance. The connection mechanism between the host (user) and the server is done with an architecture 
            where the terminal is configured in station-router mode and the access point in AP-Bridge mode acting transparently thanks to the WDS (Wireless 
            distribution system) protocol).Figure 4. WISP TopologyEach experimental sample consists of connecting a test CPE device to the corresponding access 
            point in the places already strategically defined with the established distances; Once the connection has been made, the download of the file hosted 
            on the server is started, the time measurement is taken from the start of the download until it ends. Each measurement is taken from the average of 
            five repetitions looking for greater reliability in the data obtained. The measurement of the total download time of the file and its size were taken 
            as a reference for the throughput measurement; using equation (3) to obtain the desired parameter value.The factors and levels considered in the 
            development of the experiment are presented in Table IV:

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            The application of ultrasound (40 KHz / 130W / 30 ° C / 10, 20 and 30 min) as a pretreatment to the
            convective drying of banana samples showed a significant reduction of processing time when compared to the
            control sample; reaching the greatest reduction of time of 50% for the treatment subjected to 30 min of US.
            The model that best predicts banana drying kinetics with and without the application of US is the
            exponential one. According to these results the use of ultrasound would be a potential alternative to reduce
            the drying time of bananas and vegetables in general with significant saving of energy.
