                <p>
                    Chicken meat production is one of the fastest growing industries in Colombia with an average per person  consumption  of  35.6
                    kg.  Due  to  the  increase  in  demand  and  to  the  growing  importance  of  the  chicken  meat  production  to  the  Colombian
                    economy  the  objective  of  the  study  was  to  estimate the demand and supply response and the short run elasticities for chicken 
                    meat using a two-stage least squares technique for simultaneous equations. Results indicated that chicken meat demand  was  responsive  
                    to  changes  in  own  and  beef  prices  as  well  as  income.  The  direction  of  the independent variables were as expected, with 
                    the exception of pork prices. The response of chicken meat supply to own-price changes was found to be inelastic in the short run. 
                    Chicken feed and the exchange rate elasticities did not present a great impact on the percentage changes of the quantity offered of 
                    chicken meat. The proposed model can be useful for producers, chicken meat companies managers and policymakers as understanding the 
                    factors that affect the chicken market can lead to optimal managerial and financial decisions.

                    La producción de carne de pollo es una de las industrias de más rápido crecimiento en Colombia con  un  consumo  promedio  por  persona  
                    de  35.6  kg.  Debido  al  aumento  de  la  demanda  y  la  creciente importancia de la producción de carne de pollo para la economía 
                    colombiana, el objetivo del  estudio  fue  estimar  la  respuesta  de  la  demanda  y  la  oferta  y  las  elasticidades  a  corto  plazo  
                    utilizando el modelo de ecuaciones simultaneas mediante mínimos cuadrados en dos etapas. Los resultados  indicaron  que  la  demanda  de  
                    carne  de  pollo  respondía  a  los  cambios  en  los  precios  propios y de la carne, así como a los ingresos. La dirección de las variables 
                    independientes fue la esperada, con la excepción de los precios del cerdo. Se encontró que la respuesta de la oferta de carne de pollo a los 
                    cambios en su precio era inelástica a corto plazo. Alimentos para pollo y las elasticidades del tipo de cambio no presentaron un gran impacto 
                    en los cambios porcentuales de la cantidad ofrecida de carne de pollo. El modelo propuesto puede ser útil para productores, gerentes de empresas 
                    de carne de pollo y formuladores de políticas, ya que comprender los factores que afectan el mercado del pollo puede conducir a decisiones 
                    administrativas y financieras óptimas.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
                
        <p>
            Chicken meat is an important source of dietary protein for consumers and their increased awareness and preferences for healthy and balanced food 
            have been a strong driver of growth for the industry. It is one of the most widely animal-source food eaten globally and, over the last fifty years, 
            production has increased more than 12-fold <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.

        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, chickens contribute with 89% of world poultry meat production and the largest producer is the United States  of  America  (18%  world  
            production)  followed  by  China  and  Brazil  <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.  The  chicken  meat  chain  involves production, processing and retailing and the industry plays 
            a major role in the economy as it provides employment opportunity and income generation. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In Colombia, it is one of the fastest growing industries and over the last ten years chicken meat reached 1,54 million tons, a 52,7% growth, 
            presenting the highest index of the continent. Moreover, the average per person consumption of chicken meat has consistently increased from 
            14,20 kg (2000) to 35,6 kg (2019) due most probably to prices and income factors <a href="#r3">[3]</a> <a href="#r2">[2]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several studies have concentrated on the variables that affect supply, demand and the elasticities of poultry individually. González, Rebollar 
            and Hernandez <a href="#r4">[4]</a> assessed the sensitivity of demand for poultry meat in Mexico; Purcell <a href="#r5">[5]</a> analyzed the changes in demand for beef, pork, and 
            chicken; Kapombe <a href="#r6">[6]</a> estimated the supply response for broilers in the United Sates; Goodwin, Madrigal and Martin <a href="#r7">[7]</a> estimated the impact of 
            economic variables on production, consumption, and prices in the U.S. however, only a few have focused on simultaneous estimation using two-stage 
            least squares techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            In  this  respect,  due  to  the  rise  in  demand  and  to  the  growing  importance  of  the  chicken  meat  production  to  the  Colombian economy 
            the primary purpose of the study was to estimate the demand and supply response and the short run elasticities for chicken meat using a two-stage 
            least square technique for simultaneous equations.
        </p>


        <!-- Metodología y materiales -->
        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Materials and methods
        </p>

        <p>
            A descriptive, correlational and non-experimental design was selected to describe relationships among variables. The historical data used was 
            based on information from secondary sources: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, World Bank, Colombia ́s National Poultry 
            Federation and the Ministry of Agriculture. Time series data spanning from 1991 to 2015 were collected. The data and regression model were 
            analyzed using E-views® 9 package.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Unit root tests</p>

        <p>
            The study performed the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF), the Phillips Perron (PP) and the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) tests 
            in order to verify the presence of stationarity in the time series. The ADF and the PP approach consists in testing the null hypothesis for 
            the presence of non-stationarity implying that the time series have a unit root, whilst the KPSS, on the other hand, considers as null hypothesis 
            that the series are stationary.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Endogeneity and weak instrument tests</p>

        <p>
            The Durbin-Wu-Hausmann test was also conducted in order to detect the presence of endogenous regressors so as to validate the use of a two-stage 
            least squares regression model. Moreover, the Cragg-Donald F-statistic was applied to evaluate the overall strength and validity of the instruments. 
            In this manner, the null hypothesis assumes that the instrument is weak against the alternative hypothesis of a strong instrument.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Diagnostic tests</p>

        <p>
            The Breusch-Pagan, Godfrey (BPG) and Glejser tests were performed to assess the existence of heteroscedasticity (when  the  variance  of  
            the  error  term  in  the  regression  model  varies),  whereas  the  Breusch-Godfrey  LM  test  was  conducted to examine the presence 
            of serial correlation.
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Demand and supply model</p>

        <p>
            A  traditional  way  to  model  chicken  meat  demand  and  supply  is  to  specify  chicken  production  as  a  function  of  a  measure 
            of predetermined variables. Thus, based on the classical microeconomic theory, it is assumed that a consumer behaves in such a way to optimize 
            an overall utility function subject to a budget constraint <a href="#r8">[8]</a>. Therefore, the demand for chicken meat can be written as:
        </p>

        <p>DCt = DC (PCt, PPt, PBt, PCI,)</p>

        <p>where:</p>

        <p>
            DCt = Estimated quantity of average per person consumption of chicken meat (Kilogram).<br>
            PCt = Prices paid by consumers for the purchase of chicken meat (USD/ton). <br>
            PPt and PBt = Prices of pork and beef meat (USD/ton), possible substitutes for chicken meat. <br>
            PCIt = Per capita income (USD).
        </p>

        <p>
            As  for  supply,  it  is  a  function  of  chicken  meat  price,  price  of  chicken  feed,  lagged  chicken  meat  and  feed  price  
            (maize) and exchange rate. It is important, however, to note that chicken feed is mostly imported and accounts for an average 70% of 
            farmers production cost, thus exchange rate changes could raise the cost of agricultural inputs affecting farmers profitability <a href="#r9">[9]</a>. 
            As for the lagged independent variables, it is assumed that the production of chicken meat and feed are determined by the price expected 
            in the current time period and in the previous year <a href="#r10">[10]</a> <a href="#r11">[11]</a>. Subsequently, the supply for chicken meat is as follow:
        </p>

        <p>
            SCt = SC (PCt, PCt-1, PMt, PMt-1, PSt, PSt-1, EXCRt)
        </p>

        <p>where:</p>

        <p>
            SCt = Estimated quantity of chicken meat production (ton).<br>
            PCt = Prices received by farmers for the sale of chicken meat (USD/ton).<br>
            PCt-1 = Lagged prices of chicken meat (USD/ton).<br>
            PMt = Prices paid by farmers for maize (USD/ton).<br>
            PMt-1 = Lagged prices of maize (USD).<br>
            EXCRt = Exchange rate defined as the trade value of the Colombian pesos versus theUnited States dollar ($/USD).
        </p>

        <p class="subtitulo">Econometric model specification</p>

        <p>
            Following previous studies, the model specification was based on <a href="#r10">[10]</a> with modifications, which consists of two equations - demand and 
            supply of chicken meat - and an identity equating demand and supply. Therefore, the general equations are as follow:
        </p>

        <p>
            Demand for chicken meat per person <br>
            DCt = α1 +α2PCt + α3PPt + α4PBt + α5PCIt + υ  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) 

        <p>
            Supply of chicken meat <br> 
            SCt = β1 + β2PCt + β3PCt-1 + β4PMt + β5PMt-1 + β6EXCRt ++ μ  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>
            Identity <br>
            SCt = DCt &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
        </p>

        <p>where t is the time subscript; β1 to β6 and α1 to α5 are the coefficients to be estimated; and μ and υ are error terms.</p>

        <p>
            The model consists of three endogenous (SCt, DCt and PCt), and seven pre-determined variables (PCt-1, PMt, PMt-1, EXCRt, PPt, PBt, PCIt) 
            consequently, both the demand and supply equations are identified in rank and overidentified in order condition. Moreover, solving the system 
            for either price or quantity both structural equations shows that the error terms are correlated with the endogenous variables indicating that 
            the use of ordinary least squares regression (OLS) would lead to biased and inconsistent coefficients <a href="#r12">[12]</a>. Therefore, the two stage least 
            squares (2SLS) procedure was used to estimate the structural parameters due to its effectiveness when compared to OLS but also because it is one 
            of the most used technique in the econometric literature for dealing with simultaneous equations <a href="#r13">[13]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The sign of each coefficient in (1) and (2) indicates the direction of the relationship between the independent and the response variable. 
            From this perspective, as the demand curve is hypothesized to be negatively sloped it is expected an inverse relationship between DC and PC 
            as an increase in chicken price would reduce quantity demand. On the other hand, an increase in PP or PB, potential substitute for chicken meat, 
            would tend to shift the demand for chicken upwards and increase chicken meat production levels. The coefficient on PCI should be positive as chicken 
            meat is considered  a  normal  good  in  the  sense  that  demand  for  chicken  meat  tends  to  be  positively  related  to  consumers'  income.
        </p>

        <p>
            In regards to the supply function, it is expected that an increase in PC and PCt-1 will rise SC; however, any changes in PMt, PMt-1  and  EXCRt 
            will shift the supply function. These coefficients are a reflection of an inverse relationship with SC as an increase in chicken feed price and a 
            depreciation in exchange rate will consequently reduce chicken meat production levels. Likewise, the short run demand and supply elasticities were 
            calculated in order to measure the scope of response to changes in the variables.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p class="titulo">Results and analysis</p>

        <p>
            The data in table I presents the descriptive statistics of the variables used in the study, specifically focusing on chicken  meat  price  and  
            production,  per  capita  consumption  and  income,  and  chicken  price  feed  (maize)  for  the  period 1991-2015. The average price received 
            per ton of chicken meat sold was 1.859 with a minimum of USD 1.214 and a maximum of USD 2.861. Production reached a maximum level of 1.424.388 
            ton whilst the annual per capita consumption and income were 31 kg/person and 8.213 USD, respectively. As for chicken feed, prices presented an 
            upward trend due to the growing demand from the animal feed industry, specifically the poultry sector that accounts for 66 per cent of total feed 
            imports, reaching a maximum of 433 (USD/ton).

        <p class="titulo">Unit root, endogeneity and weak instrument tests</p>

        <p>
            According  to  <a href="#r12">[12]</a>  in  order  to  provide  valid  statistical  inference  and  avoid  problems  with  spurious  results,  it  is important to 
            examine the stationarity of the variables before proceeding with the estimation of the model. Therefore, all variables were tested using the 
            Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) unit root test as well as the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) stationary test.
        </p>

        <p>
            The results shown in table II indicate that in the level form for the ADF and PP all variables are higher than the critical values with the 
            exception of PM and PMt-1 where they are significant at a 5% level for constant and linear trend. For the KPSS test, all series have a stationary 
            property, even at a 10% level of significance. In the first difference, all variables are stationary around a constant, constant and linear trend 
            mostly at 5% and 10% (ADF and PP) and 1% (KPSS) significance level therefore, as a whole the results suggest that the series used are integrated 
            of order one I(1).
        </p>

        <p>
            In regards to the Durbin-Wu-Hausmann endogeneity test the null hypothesis is rejected which confirms the assumption that PC is an endogenous variable. 
            Furthermore, when testing for weak instruments the Cragg Donald F-statistic (F= 33,43 for demand; F = 24,18 for supply), were well above the rule of 
            thumb guideline (F > 10), implying that the instruments are relevant.

        <p>Estimated models</p>

            Table III provides the 2SLS estimated results of the demand and supply proposed models as specified previously in (1) and (2).

            Results showed that the p-values (p < 0,05) associated to the t-statistic of the explanatory variables are significant, 
            with the exception of PP, PCt-1 and PMt-1. The coefficients of determination (R-squared values) for the demand and supply 
            function were high however, <a href="#r14">[14]</a> <a href="#r15">[15]</a> argue that in system equations, it is not well defined; therefore, it is not a 
            goodness-of-fit indicator (Table III).
        </p>

        <p>
            The demand equation generated coefficients with the expected signs for PC, PB and PCI and are theoretically correct; however, 
            this was not the case for PP. This suggests that an increase in own-prices will have a negative impact on demand; on the other 
            hand higher beef prices as well as rising consumers ́ incomes will lead to an increase in chicken meat production levels.  For 
            the estimated supply quantity-dependent equation, all variables bear right signs. This indicates a direct relationship between 
            production levels and own and lagged-prices and an inverse one with exchange  rate  and  chicken  feed  prices,  therefore,  if  
            chicken  feed  prices  decreases  the  production  of  chicken  meat  should increase and vice-versa.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Breusch-Pagan, Godfrey (BPG) and Glejser tests were applied on the two-equations ́ residuals and the null hypothesis  for  no  
            heteroscedasticity  was  not  rejected.  Moreover,  there  is  a  lack  of  evidence  of  serial  correlation  as the chi-squares 
            and p-values of the Breusch-Godffrey test are not significant suggesting the non-presence of autocorrelation (Table IV).

        <p>
            The short run elasticities calculated for the proposed demand and supply model are shown in table V. The own-price demand elasticity 
            for chicken meat indicates that if chicken meat price increase 1%, production will decrease 0,77 %. As for the cross-price elasticity 
            (Ɛdcp = 0,476), the study indicates that beef meat is a substitute for chicken meat and changes in prices will lead consumers to shift 
            toward a lower cost product. However, the cross-price elasticity of  demand  for  chicken  and  pork  had  unexpected  opposite  signs  
            therefore,  a  concrete  conclusion  on  the  degree  of  competition or complementarity between both variables could not be reached. 
            Likewise, the value of income elasticity (Ɛdi = 0,84) was quite high suggesting that chicken meat is sensitive to changes in income.
        </p>

        <p>
            Concerning  the  own-price  supply  elasticity  of  chicken  meat  an  increase  in  price  will  induce  producers  to  supply
            larger quantities, thus a price increase of 1% will rise production in 0,59%. It is important to highlight that in related studies
            supply response also showed an inelastic response to market prices [6] [16]). With regards to chicken feed and the exchange rate 
            elasticities both were low (-0,23 and -0,27, respectively) which would imply that they do not present a great impact on the percentage 
            changes of the quantity offered of chicken meat.

         <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>

         <p>
            In conclusion, a simultaneous equation model of chicken meat demand and supply was specified and estimated using two-stage least 
            squares. The overall fits of the demand and supply equations were generally good.
         </p>

         <p>
            Results indicated that chicken meat demand was responsive to changes in own and beef prices as well as income. The direction of the 
            independent variables were as expected and in accordance with the economic theory, with the exception of pork prices. On the other 
            hand, the response of chicken meat supply to own-price changes was found to be inelastic in the short run. Concerning chicken feed and 
            the exchange rate elasticities, they did not present a great impact on the percentage changes of the quantity offered of chicken meat.
         </p>

         <p>
            Consequently, the proposed supply and demand model for chicken meat can be useful for producers, chicken meat companies managers and 
            policymakers as understanding the factors that affect the chicken market can lead to optimal managerial and financial decisions.
