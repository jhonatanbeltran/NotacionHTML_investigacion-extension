                    Debido a la reducida cantidad de estudios de energía eólico al interior de Colombia, el objetivo
                     de este estudio es determinar el potencial eólico del municipio de Guasca así como su viabilidad 
                     en  la  generación  de  energía,  para  ello  se  recolectaron  los  datos  correspondientes  a  
                     los  años  de  2017, 2018 y 2019 de las estaciones meteorológicas que pudiesen medir datos de 
                     velocidad de viento tanto dentro del municipio como en los alrededores del mismo (Páramo Chingaza, PNN 
                     Chingaza y PTAR Tocancipá) para luego analizar los datos con ayuda del software Windographer. La información 
                     generada a partir del análisis muestra que los valores más altos en velocidad de viento proceden del sur del 
                     municipio los cuales alcanzan los 4 m/s, así mismo se observa que el flujo del viento en el municipio proviene 
                     principalmente desde el este y atraviesa el municipio en dirección  oeste.  Los  análisis  de  densidad  de  
                     potencia  mostraron  que  la  mayor  oferta  energética  se  encuentra  al  sur  del  municipio,  donde  los  
                     valores  de  densidad  de  potencia  alcanzan  los  40  W/m2, para evaluar esta oferta eólica se realizó una 
                     búsqueda de turbinas eólicas que pudiesen aprovechar las condiciones del municipio, mostrando una generación 
                     energética que oscila entre 19,669.02 KWh y 42,711.59 KWh lo que puede considerarse útil para la autosuficiencia

                    Due  to  the  reduced  number  of  wind  energy  studies  in  the  interior  of  Colombia,  the  objective  of  this 
                    study is to determine the wind potential of the municipality of Guasca as well as its viability in energy generation,
                    for this the data corresponding to the years of 2017, 2018 and 2019 of the meteorological stations  that  could  measure
                    wind  speed  data  both  within  the  municipality  and  in  its  surroundings  was  gathered (Páramo Chingaza,
                    PNN Chingaza and PTAR Tocancipá) and then data was analyzed with the help of the Windographer software.
                    The information generated from the analysis shows that the highest values in wind speed come from the south
                    of the municipality, which reach 4 m/s, likewise it is observed that the wind flow in the municipality comes 
                    mainly from the east and crosses the municipality to the west. The power density analyzes showed that the greatest
                    energy supply is located in the south of the municipality, where the power density values reach 40 W/m2, to evaluate 
                    this wind supply a search was carried out for wind turbines that could take advantage of the conditions of the municipality,
                    showing an energy generation that ranges between 19,669.02 KWh and 42,711.59 KWh, which can be considered useful for
                    self-sufficiency at the residential level.

        <!--Introducción-->
        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
                
        <p>
            Energy  constitutes  a  fundamental  part  of  human  daily  life  and  for  the  development  of  society,  an  immaterial  and  fundamental
            component of the universe as well as something vital for civilization [1] [2]. Wolfgang Bauer and Gary Westfall state the importance of energy 
            as follows: "No physical quantity is more important in our daily life than energy". [3] For decades this growing need for energy was covered
            mainly by fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas,  which  generated  social,  environmental  and  social  problems  such  as  problems
            of  air  pollution  resulting  from  the waste of these fuels known as greenhouse gases. [4] [5] The international contribution of fossil fuels, 
            although it has decreased since in 2011 oil accounted for 40% of the energy consumed in the world, five percent less than in 2001, while coal and 
            natural gas accounted for 25% and 21% respectively, still maintains these energy sources as the main and most important in the world. [6] This is 
            in large part because various political and social actors justify the dependence on these fuels for their economic and geopolitical interests. [6]

        </p>

        <p>
            Due to the increasing demand for energy worldwide, the growing interest in the effects of climate change, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas 
            emissions, renewable energies, such as wind energy, are growing rapidly [7] Renewable energies  -in  this  case,  wind  energy-  as  described  by
            the  Institute  of  Meteorology,  Hydrology,  and  Environmental  Studies -IDEAM-, are nowadays valuable resources, cleaner than those originated
            in fossil sources, these resources are  increasingly  competitive,  especially  if  we  take  into  consideration  that  they  allow  auguring  a
            more  sustainable  development on Earth. [8] Wind energy is the electrical energy obtained from the wind. i.e. from a certain point of view, wind
            energy can be understood as an indirect form of solar energy since it is the heat produced by the sun that causes the air masses to move by causing
            variations in pressure, wind energy varies greatly from one place to another due to the irregularities of the terrain. [9] [10] Wind power has commonly
            been used to pump groundwater to the surface or to grind grain into flour, but modern wind power plants generate electricity for homes, factories, etc.
            [11]To generate wind energy, it is necessary to take into account something fundamental about the wind, and that is that two data are of interest, above
            all: course and speed. [12] The wind direction changes in time which are connected to the behaviour of the temporal wind flow caused by different
            geographical and atmospheric factors. [13] Among these are factors such as the Coriolis force which is mainly produced by the rotation of the earth,
            however, it should be clarified that this force does not generate wind but modifies the direction of the air masses; it should also be noted that in 
            the equatorial zone this force is null. [11] [14] It is also worth mentioning that in the equatorial zone this force is null, in this zone the trade 
            winds are present instead. The Coriolis force together with the influence of high-pressure zones causes the flow of these very constant currents of wind 
            from east to west in the equatorial zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone.[11] [12] The wind direction is also affected by different geographical
            and atmospheric factors: the force produced by the pressure gradient increases the wind speed, which is evident in places with strong winds that in turn
            evidence high-pressure gradients. [11] [12] On the other hand, friction decreases wind speed, especially during the first 1.5 km of the Earth's atmosphere;
            this friction is mainly because the air masses are in constant friction with the ground and geographical accidents. [11]
        </p>

        <p>
            In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field, proof of this is the wind energy studies conducted throughout the world such as China where
            a wind potential study was conducted in Jiangsu [15] Thailand, where a wind potential study was carried out in the Hat Yai campus of the Prince of Songkla University.
            [2] Multi-criteria analysis for the offshore wind potential in Egypt [16]. Kaoga et al. [17] conducted a study of wind potential in the far north of Cameroon highlighting
            the geography of the region which is part of the Mandara Mountains. [17] Nawri et al. [18]carried out a study of wind potential in Iceland. [18] In the region of Baja California,
            the effects of meteorologicalphenomena in the area on the wind potential of the region were studied, [19] an evaluation of the wind potential in thestate of Veracruz (Mexico)
            [20] among many other studies found at the international level.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the national level, however, there are few studies on the subject at least in a more specific way. Besides the Jepirachi wind farm, which is the only wind farm in the country to date,
            [21] and a small group of wind studies relegated to the department of La Guajira and the Caribbean coast, there are few studies on the subject, at least in a more specific way. 

        </p>

        <p>
            [22][23] A study of the wind resource in Bogota [24] a statistical analysis of wind distribution in the Aburrá Valley[25]and a study of wind potential in the Chontales páramo.
            [26] This shows little interest in the subject at the nationallevel, relegating research to the Caribbean coast and specific locations in urban areas, leaving aside other
            locationsthat may present suitable conditions for wind power generation, therefore, this study can open a new perspective onthe field of wind energy and new points of view in
            its implementation, likewise, this study can be a starting point forthe implementation of wind energy systems on a larger scale in the country, or in mountain areas similar to the study

        <p class="titulo"> <b>Methodology</b> </p>

        <p class="subtitulo"> <b>Study Area</b></p>

        <p>The  present  research  was  conducted  in  the  municipality  of  Guasca,  located  in  the  department  of  Cundinamarca,  Guasca has an average temperature of 13 °C and is located at an 
            altitude of 2,800 Height above mean sea level. It is located between the  cold   and  paramo thermal floors.    [27]  To the    east,   the  town   is surrounded by  the  Chingaza National
            Natural Park, [27] [28] towards the northwest is the Tominé Reservoir. [29] Finally to the west is the Pionono hill in the neighboring municipality of Sopó.

        <p class="subtitulo"><b>Materials and Methods</b></p>

        <p>
            <b>for  meteorological  stations:</b>  For  the  present  research,  the  search  for  meteorological  stations  that  could  measure wind speed and direction present in the study area or 
            adjacent to it was carried out, once these stations were located, the request for information was made to the entities that own them (for this case they were the Corporación Autónoma Regional
            de Cundinamarca - CAR, and the Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales -IDEAM) discarding according to the available information those stations that did not have enough data
            to be usedin the subsequent analyses, finally obtaining the following stations (Table I):

        </div>

        <p>
            It should be clarified that a fourth meteorological station located in the municipality of Guatavita was used which, although it does not have data on wind speed or direction, due to its history of
            having recorded such data in the past and its geographical location was useful to perform the corresponding interpolation work of the subsequent analysis. In that sense, it was also considered a station 
            located within the study area called "Santa Cruz de Siecha", but in the end, it had to be discarded due to lack of data for the year 2019.

        </div>

        <p>
            <b>Quality Control of Data Obtained: </b>For the present research, daily frequency data series corresponding to the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used. To obtain greater reliability of the data, an initial
            quality control process was carried out,  which  consisted  of  eliminating  inconsistent  data  from  the  series  -for  example,  negative  speed  data-,  and  data  whose values were three times greater
            than the standard deviation obtained in the statistical description of the series were also eliminated.
        </p>

        <p><b>Data  Filling: </b>To obtain the total reliability of the data obtained it was also necessary to perform a data filling process which consists of filling any data gaps in the series (Table II) using
              mathematical methods. For this study, the Windographer program was used, which can perform data filling through a stochastic process known as Markov Chains. [31] This process can be defined as any
              process in which the probability of a future event can be predicted based only on the immediately preceding events, which implies that the Markov chain and the events that compose it will show identical
               behavior at any moment in time in which it is observed. [32] [33] [34]</p>

            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img4.png" height="300px" width="auto">
        </div>
         
         <p><b>Statistical analysis of the data: </b>Having obtained reliability in the data we proceed to perform the corresponding statistical analysis of the data using the Weibull probability distribution.
               The probability distributions are mathematical models that serve to determine the probability of occurrence or the behavior of a variable, data or series of data; In the case of wind, a variety
               of probability distributions can be used to describe the properties of the wind such as direction and speed, as well as the Weibull distribution is widely considered as the probability distribution
               of occurrence. [35] Likewise, the Weibull distribution is widely considered to be the most suitable probability distribution for analyzing wind speed data given the variety of curves that can result
               from the use of different parameters related to this wind characteristic.[34][25][36] The Weibull function is characterized by two parameters: a scale parameter and a shape parameter; the scale parameter
               defines how sparse the distribution is while the shape parameter defines the shape of the distribution [37]</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img5.png" height="280px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>For  this  study  we  used  the  statistical  function  of  the  Windographer  program,  which  can  import  and  analyze  wind  resource information from different formats and automatically detect the structure
           of the same, allowing a quick quality control and statistical analysis. [31][38]</p>

        <p><b>Statistical  description  of  the  data: </b>once  the  data  quality  control  was  performed,  the  corresponding  statistical  analysis was carried out, which consisted basically in obtaining the measures of
              central tendency of the data series (mean, standard deviation, variance, box plot). [34][35][36] This was a dominion to study the behavior of the data series and to be able to have more clarity about the possible
              results of the subsequent analysis.</p>

        <p><b>Wind  Direction  Description: </b>To  develop  the  description  of  the  wind  direction  it  was  not  possible  to  use  the  WRPLOT program because this program only elaborates wind roses from hourly frequency 
              data series, therefore, being the data of this study daily frequency, we chose the special tool for wind roses of the Windographer program. [39,p.40] Therefore, as the data for this study is of daily frequency, we
              opted for the special tool for wind roses of the Windographer program, [31] with which the wind roses of the three stations within the study period were elaborated, which allowed determining the predominant direction
              of the wind. [19] These roses plot the direction of the wind flow showing where the wind comes from, which is useful for the development of the spatial analysis of the wind roses.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            The application of ultrasound (40 KHz / 130W / 30 ° C / 10, 20 and 30 min) as a pretreatment to the
            convective drying of banana samples showed a significant reduction of processing time when compared to the
            control sample; reaching the greatest reduction of time of 50% for the treatment subjected to 30 min of US.
            The model that best predicts banana drying kinetics with and without the application of US is the
            exponential one. According to these results the use of ultrasound would be a potential alternative to reduce
            the drying time of bananas and vegetables in general with significant saving of energy.
