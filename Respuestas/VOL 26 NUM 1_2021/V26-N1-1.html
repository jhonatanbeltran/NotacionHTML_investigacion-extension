                    Debido a la reducida cantidad de estudios de energía eólico al interior de Colombia, el objetivo
                     de este estudio es determinar el potencial eólico del municipio de Guasca así como su viabilidad 
                     en  la  generación  de  energía,  para  ello  se  recolectaron  los  datos  correspondientes  a  
                     los  años  de  2017, 2018 y 2019 de las estaciones meteorológicas que pudiesen medir datos de 
                     velocidad de viento tanto dentro del municipio como en los alrededores del mismo (Páramo Chingaza, PNN 
                     Chingaza y PTAR Tocancipá) para luego analizar los datos con ayuda del software Windographer. La información 
                     generada a partir del análisis muestra que los valores más altos en velocidad de viento proceden del sur del 
                     municipio los cuales alcanzan los 4 m/s, así mismo se observa que el flujo del viento en el municipio proviene 
                     principalmente desde el este y atraviesa el municipio en dirección  oeste.  Los  análisis  de  densidad  de  
                     potencia  mostraron  que  la  mayor  oferta  energética  se  encuentra  al  sur  del  municipio,  donde  los  
                     valores  de  densidad  de  potencia  alcanzan  los  40  W/m2, para evaluar esta oferta eólica se realizó una 
                     búsqueda de turbinas eólicas que pudiesen aprovechar las condiciones del municipio, mostrando una generación 
                     energética que oscila entre 19,669.02 KWh y 42,711.59 KWh lo que puede considerarse útil para la autosuficiencia 
                     a nivel residencial.

                    Due  to  the  reduced  number  of  wind  energy  studies  in  the  interior  of  Colombia,  the  objective  of  this 
                    study is to determine the wind potential of the municipality of Guasca as well as its viability in energy generation,
                    for this the data corresponding to the years of 2017, 2018 and 2019 of the meteorological stations  that  could  measure
                    wind  speed  data  both  within  the  municipality  and  in  its  surroundings  was  gathered (Páramo Chingaza,
                    PNN Chingaza and PTAR Tocancipá) and then data was analyzed with the help of the Windographer software.
                    The information generated from the analysis shows that the highest values in wind speed come from the south
                    of the municipality, which reach 4 m/s, likewise it is observed that the wind flow in the municipality comes 
                    mainly from the east and crosses the municipality to the west. The power density analyzes showed that the greatest
                    energy supply is located in the south of the municipality, where the power density values reach 40 W/m2, to evaluate 
                    this wind supply a search was carried out for wind turbines that could take advantage of the conditions of the municipality,
                    showing an energy generation that ranges between 19,669.02 KWh and 42,711.59 KWh, which can be considered useful for
                    self-sufficiency at the residential level.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
                
        <p>
            Energy  constitutes  a  fundamental  part  of  human  daily  life  and  for  the  development  of  society,  an  immaterial  and  fundamental
            component of the universe as well as something vital for civilization <a href="#r1">[1]</a> <a href="#r2">[2]</a>. Wolfgang Bauer and Gary Westfall state the importance of energy 
            as follows: "No physical quantity is more important in our daily life than energy". <a href="#r3">[3]</a> For decades this growing need for energy was covered
            mainly by fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas,  which  generated  social,  environmental  and  social  problems  such  as  problems
            of  air  pollution  resulting  from  the waste of these fuels known as greenhouse gases. <a href="#r4">[4]</a> <a href="#r5">[5]</a> The international contribution of fossil fuels, 
            although it has decreased since in 2011 oil accounted for 40% of the energy consumed in the world, five percent less than in 2001, while coal and 
            natural gas accounted for 25% and 21% respectively, still maintains these energy sources as the main and most important in the world. <a href="#r6">[6]</a> This is 
            in large part because various political and social actors justify the dependence on these fuels for their economic and geopolitical interests. <a href="#r6">[6]</a>

        </p>

        <p>
            Due to the increasing demand for energy worldwide, the growing interest in the effects of climate change, and the desire to reduce greenhouse gas 
            emissions, renewable energies, such as wind energy, are growing rapidly <a href="#r7">[7]</a> Renewable energies  -in  this  case,  wind  energy-  as  described  by
            the  Institute  of  Meteorology,  Hydrology,  and  Environmental  Studies -IDEAM-, are nowadays valuable resources, cleaner than those originated
            in fossil sources, these resources are  increasingly  competitive,  especially  if  we  take  into  consideration  that  they  allow  auguring  a
            more  sustainable  development on Earth. <a href="#r8">[8]</a> Wind energy is the electrical energy obtained from the wind. i.e. from a certain point of view, wind
            energy can be understood as an indirect form of solar energy since it is the heat produced by the sun that causes the air masses to move by causing
            variations in pressure, wind energy varies greatly from one place to another due to the irregularities of the terrain. <a href="#r9">[9]</a> <a href="#r10">[10]</a> Wind power has commonly
            been used to pump groundwater to the surface or to grind grain into flour, but modern wind power plants generate electricity for homes, factories, etc.
            <a href="#r11">[11]</a> To generate wind energy, it is necessary to take into account something fundamental about the wind, and that is that two data are of interest, above
            all: course and speed. <a href="#r12">[12]</a> The wind direction changes in time which are connected to the behaviour of the temporal wind flow caused by different
            geographical and atmospheric factors. <a href="#r13">[13]</a> Among these are factors such as the Coriolis force which is mainly produced by the rotation of the earth,
            however, it should be clarified that this force does not generate wind but modifies the direction of the air masses; it should also be noted that in 
            the equatorial zone this force is null. <a href="#r11">[11]</a> <a href="#r14">[14]</a> It is also worth mentioning that in the equatorial zone this force is null, in this zone the trade 
            winds are present instead. The Coriolis force together with the influence of high-pressure zones causes the flow of these very constant currents of wind 
            from east to west in the equatorial zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone. <a href="#r11">[11]</a> <a href="#r12">[12]</a> The wind direction is also affected by different geographical
            and atmospheric factors: the force produced by the pressure gradient increases the wind speed, which is evident in places with strong winds that in turn
            evidence high-pressure gradients. <a href="#r11">[11]</a> <a href="#r12">[12]</a> On the other hand, friction decreases wind speed, especially during the first 1.5 km of the Earth's atmosphere;
            this friction is mainly because the air masses are in constant friction with the ground and geographical accidents. <a href="#r11">[11]</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field, proof of this is the wind energy studies conducted throughout the world such as China where
            a wind potential study was conducted in Jiangsu <a href="#r15">[15]</a> Thailand, where a wind potential study was carried out in the Hat Yai campus of the Prince of Songkla University.
            <a href="#r2">[2]</a> Multi-criteria analysis for the offshore wind potential in Egypt [16]. Kaoga et al. <a href="#r17">[17]</a> conducted a study of wind potential in the far north of Cameroon highlighting
            the geography of the region which is part of the Mandara Mountains. <a href="#r17">[17]</a> Nawri et al. <a href="#r18">[18]</a>carried out a study of wind potential in Iceland. <a href="#r18">[18]</a> In the region of Baja California,
            the effects of meteorologicalphenomena in the area on the wind potential of the region were studied, <a href="#r19">[19]</a> an evaluation of the wind potential in thestate of Veracruz (Mexico)
            <a href="#r20">[20]</a> among many other studies found at the international level.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the national level, however, there are few studies on the subject at least in a more specific way. Besides the Jepirachi wind farm, which is the only wind farm in the country to date,
            <a href="#r21">[21]</a> and a small group of wind studies relegated to the department of La Guajira and the Caribbean coast, there are few studies on the subject, at least in a more specific way. 

        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="#r22">[22]</a><a href="#r23">[23]</a> A study of the wind resource in Bogota <a href="#r24">[24]</a> a statistical analysis of wind distribution in the Aburrá Valley[25]and a study of wind potential in the Chontales páramo.
            <a href="#r26">[26]</a> This shows little interest in the subject at the nationallevel, relegating research to the Caribbean coast and specific locations in urban areas, leaving aside other
            locationsthat may present suitable conditions for wind power generation, therefore, this study can open a new perspective onthe field of wind energy and new points of view in
            its implementation, likewise, this study can be a starting point forthe implementation of wind energy systems on a larger scale in the country, or in mountain areas similar to the study

        <p class="subtitulo"> <b>Study Area</b></p>

        <p>The  present  research  was  conducted  in  the  municipality  of  Guasca,  located  in  the  department  of  Cundinamarca,  Guasca has an average temperature of 13 °C and is located at an 
            altitude of 2,800 Height above mean sea level. It is located between the  cold   and  paramo thermal floors.  <a href="#r27">[27]</a>  To the    east,   the  town   is surrounded by  the  Chingaza National
            Natural Park, <a href="#r27">[27]</a> <a href="#r28">[28]</a> towards the northwest is the Tominé Reservoir. <a href="#r29">[29]</a> Finally to the west is the Pionono hill in the neighboring municipality of Sopó.

        <p class="subtitulo"><b>Materials and Methods</b></p>

        <p>
            <b>for  meteorological  stations:</b>  For  the  present  research,  the  search  for  meteorological  stations  that  could  measure wind speed and direction present in the study area or 
            adjacent to it was carried out, once these stations were located, the request for information was made to the entities that own them (for this case they were the Corporación Autónoma Regional
            de Cundinamarca - CAR, and the Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales -IDEAM) discarding according to the available information those stations that did not have enough data
            to be usedin the subsequent analyses, finally obtaining the following stations (Table I):

            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img2.png" height="200px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
            It should be clarified that a fourth meteorological station located in the municipality of Guatavita was used which, although it does not have data on wind speed or direction, due to its history of
            having recorded such data in the past and its geographical location was useful to perform the corresponding interpolation work of the subsequent analysis. In that sense, it was also considered a station 
            located within the study area called "Santa Cruz de Siecha", but in the end, it had to be discarded due to lack of data for the year 2019.

        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img3.png" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
            <b>Quality Control of Data Obtained: </b>For the present research, daily frequency data series corresponding to the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used. To obtain greater reliability of the data, an initial
            quality control process was carried out,  which  consisted  of  eliminating  inconsistent  data  from  the  series  -for  example,  negative  speed  data-,  and  data  whose values were three times greater
            than the standard deviation obtained in the statistical description of the series were also eliminated.
        </p>

        <p><b>Data  Filling: </b>To obtain the total reliability of the data obtained it was also necessary to perform a data filling process which consists of filling any data gaps in the series (Table II) using
              mathematical methods. For this study, the Windographer program was used, which can perform data filling through a stochastic process known as Markov Chains. <a href="#r31">[31]</a> This process can be defined as any
              process in which the probability of a future event can be predicted based only on the immediately preceding events, which implies that the Markov chain and the events that compose it will show identical
               behavior at any moment in time in which it is observed. <a href="#r32">[32]</a> <a href="#r33">[33]</a> <a href="#r34">[34]</a> </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img4.png" height="300px" width="auto">
        </div>
         
         <p><b>Statistical analysis of the data: </b>Having obtained reliability in the data we proceed to perform the corresponding statistical analysis of the data using the Weibull probability distribution.
               The probability distributions are mathematical models that serve to determine the probability of occurrence or the behavior of a variable, data or series of data; In the case of wind, a variety
               of probability distributions can be used to describe the properties of the wind such as direction and speed, as well as the Weibull distribution is widely considered as the probability distribution
               of occurrence. <a href="#r35">[35]</a> Likewise, the Weibull distribution is widely considered to be the most suitable probability distribution for analyzing wind speed data given the variety of curves that can result
               from the use of different parameters related to this wind characteristic.<a href="#r34">[34]</a> <a href="#r25">[25]</a> <a href="#r36">[36]</a> The Weibull function is characterized by two parameters: a scale parameter and a shape parameter; the scale parameter
               defines how sparse the distribution is while the shape parameter defines the shape of the distribution <a href="#r37">[37]</a></p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img5.png" height="280px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>For  this  study  we  used  the  statistical  function  of  the  Windographer  program,  which  can  import  and  analyze  wind  resource information from different formats and automatically detect the structure
           of the same, allowing a quick quality control and statistical analysis. <a href="#r31">[31]</a> <a href="#r38">[38]</a></p>

        <p><b>Statistical  description  of  the  data: </b>once  the  data  quality  control  was  performed,  the  corresponding  statistical  analysis was carried out, which consisted basically in obtaining the measures of
              central tendency of the data series (mean, standard deviation, variance, box plot). <a href="#r34">[34]</a> <a href="#r35">[35]</a> <a href="#r36">[36]</a> This was a dominion to study the behavior of the data series and to be able to have more clarity about the possible
              results of the subsequent analysis.</p>

        <p><b>Wind  Direction  Description: </b>To  develop  the  description  of  the  wind  direction  it  was  not  possible  to  use  the  WRPLOT program because this program only elaborates wind roses from hourly frequency 
              data series, therefore, being the data of this study daily frequency, we chose the special tool for wind roses of the Windographer program. <a href="#r39">[39]</a> <a href="#r40">[40]</a> Therefore, as the data for this study is of daily frequency, we
              opted for the special tool for wind roses of the Windographer program, <a href="#r31">[31]</a> with which the wind roses of the three stations within the study period were elaborated, which allowed determining the predominant direction
              of the wind. <a href="#r19">[19]</a> These roses plot the direction of the wind flow showing where the wind comes from, which is useful for the development of the spatial analysis of the wind roses.</p>

        <p><b>Spatial  and  vector  analysis  of  the  wind: </b>To carry out the energy analysis of the municipality, the Windographer program was used once again, this time a special tool was used that allows the analysis of the 
              power density of the data series in W/m2 as well as the classification of the wind according to the energy it can produce. <a href="#r31">[31]</a> Once these data were obtained, we proceeded to georeference them in the coordinate system
              mentioned above in the ArcGIS™ software, then the geostatistical  interpolation  of  the  energy  data  was  performed  in  the  same  way  that  was  done  with  the  wind  data,  to obtain fields of equal energy magnitude
              within the municipality which allows identifying areas of high energy density that can be used to generate energy.</p>

        <p><b>Determination and selection of wind turbines: </b>Consequently, with the energy data of the municipality, a review of  the  possible  wind  turbines  capable  of  generating  energy  with  the  conditions  present  in  the
              municipality  was  carried out, taking into account the factory specifications of the turbines consulted, such as turbine start-up speed, orientation, number of blades, nominal power, etc. (Tables 3a and 3b), <a href="#r10">[10]</a> <a href="#r41">[41]</a>, etc.
               (Tables IIIa and IIIb). For practical purposes, the wind turbine catalog of Windographer <a href="#r31">[31]</a> because in this catalog can also be found wind turbines that can be useful for this research.</p>

        <p><b>Determination of estimated performance and restrictions of wind turbines: </b>Once the review of wind turbines and energy data from the study area was done, we proceeded to evaluate the energy that can generate these wind
             turbines using the Windographer program which has an application capable of performing analysis of turbine output power and net energy generated. <a href="#r38">[38]</a>  <a href="#r31">[31]</a>  Afterward, possible environmental restrictions - humidity and temperature
              - that could affect the generation of energy in the municipality were evaluated.</p>

              
        <p class="titulo"> <b>Analysis of Results</b> </p>

        <p>In this section, you will find the results obtained from this research in statistical, spatial and vector matters, as well as the discussion and comparison with previous studies.</p>
 
        <p><b>Statistical analysis of the data: </b>To determine the degree of relationship existing between the distribution of the data and the Weibull probability function, a histogram was used to compare the velocity frequencies of the
              data with the Weibull probability, as well as the statistical coefficient of determination that can take a value between zero and one, where one represents a perfect fit between the distribution of the data and the probability 
              function used, as can be seen in the following figure, the station Paramo Chingaza a statistical coefficient R2of 0.8052.</p>

        <div class="image">
             <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img7.png" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>


        <p>According to the histogram, it can be seen that the winds with the highest frequency are winds with speeds less than 4 m/s, however at a general level the distribution of the data tends to look quite similar to the Gaussian or normal
           distribution,  this  corresponds  to  the  information  of  the  wind  atlas  of  Colombia  where  the  distribution  of  the  wind  speed data also tends to the Gaussian or normal distribution. <a href="#r42">[42]</a>  Regarding the statistical analysis,
           the Weibull k shape factor for the analyzed stations was grouped and observed, identifying that the station with the highest value of this shape factor is the distribution corresponding to the PTAR Tocancipá station with a k= 5.137, followed
           by the stations  Páramo  Chingaza  and  PNN  Chingaza  with  values  of  k=  3.169  and  k=  2.883  respectively,  while  about  the  Weibull scale factor c the highest value corresponds to the station Páramo Chingaza with a value c= 4.655 followed
           by the stations PNN Chingaza and PTAR Tocancipá with values c= 1.955 and c= 1.893 respectively (Table IV), the latter indicates the potential of the study area according to Azal et al. <a href="#r43">[43]</a>  the higher the value of the factor c is, the higher the wind 
           potential of the site.<a href="#r43">[43]</a> </p>

        <p>In the study area, a relationship between the standard deviations and the maximum values registered in this set of stations can be observed, since it is observed that the highest values of standard deviation as well as maximum speed corresponding to
           the Páramo Chingaza station with values of 1.406 m/s and 8.388 m/s respectively, in the same way, the lowest values of standard deviation (0.38 m/s) and maximum speed (3.071 m/s) correspond to the PTAR Tocancipá station.  Regarding  the  frequency  tables,
           these  allow  observing  together  with  the  standard  deviation  data  that  the  PNN Chingaza and PTAR Tocancipá stations present the highest stability in wind magnitude since they have a high percentage of data within the range corresponding to the mean 
           (79.72% and 82.47% respectively) while the Páramo Chingaza station is the most variable station since 63.01% of the data is outside the interval corresponding to the mean (Table V). </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img8.png" height="520px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Regarding the averages of the study area (Table IV) it is observed that the station Páramo Chingaza has the highest value of all averages, with a value of 4.167 m/s compared to the values of the other two stations PNN Chingaza and PTAR Tocancipá (1.743 m/s and
           1.741 m/s respectively), the value shown by the Páramo Chingaza station is similar to that shown in the Kousseri region in the extreme north of Cameroon where the wind speed values oscillate between 3.29 m/s and 4.38 m/s. <a href="#r17">[17]</a>  .</p>

        <p><b>Wind  Direction  Description: </b>The following is a description of the information obtained from the wind roses for each of the stations used in the study period:</p>

        <p><b>Páramo  Chingaza: </b>The  wind  roses  of  this  station  show  that  the  wind  comes  from  the  south-southeast  direction  mainly, followed by a smaller but appreciable tendency of coming from the east directly, indicating that the wind flow comes from the
              southeast with direction towards the northeast of the station.</p>   

        <p><b>Chingaza NP: </b>The wind roses for this station show a visibly more varied behavior than the other two stations as the wind seems to come from all directions, highlighting two main trends that show origin from both east and northwest, this may be due to the location
              of the station as well as nearby elements that may alter the wind flow near it.</p>

        <p><b>PTAR Tocancipá: </b>The wind roses of this station show a constant behaviour of the wind flow which comes almost entirely from the east, which shows that the wind flow moves from the east towards the west of the station, a behaviour that could also occur to the north 
            of the study area.</p>

        <div class="image">
             <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img9.png" height="240px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>The information obtained from the wind roses shows a quite unequal behaviour of the wind regime from one station to another, however all the stations show a common characteristic and that is that the wind flow comes mainly from the east and crosses the municipality towards 
           the west, as shown in the following figure.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img10.png" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>This behaviour is similar to the observation in the wind potential study by Zamora, Lambert and Montero in Baja California, where there are also wind trends from the east to the west in the Mexicali region. <a href="#r19">[19]</a> This behaviour can be explained at a more general level, because
           being located between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Colombia is subject to receive the trade winds coming from the northeast in the northern hemisphere and from the southeast in the southern hemisphere.<a href="#r22">[22]</a><a href="#r42">[42]</a> </p>

        <p><b>Spatial and vector analysis of the wind: </b>When performing the spatial and vector analysis of the data it is observed that the wind flow in the municipality behaves in a very similar way to that shown by the wind roses, according to the geostatistical analysis two wind 
              currents are observed, the first coming from the northeast through the municipality of Guatavita, and the second coming from the southeast from the Chingaza páramo, both converge in the municipality of Guasca with direction towards the west of the municipality. In the same
              way it can be observed that the highest wind speeds are found towards the southern region of the municipality, which shows speeds that reach 4 m/s, similar to what Avellaneda Cusaria's study shows in the Chontales páramo, where it is shown that the average wind speed is in 
              the interval of 4 and 5 m/s, which is also similar to the results obtained in the study of the Chontales páramo. <a href="#r26">[26]</a>It is also similar to the results obtained in the Hatyai campus of the Prince of Songkla University where an average wind speed of 3.86 m/s is shown. <a href="#r2">[2]</a> </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img11.png" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>According  to  the  Beaufort  scale,  the  wind  speeds  present  at  the  Páramo  Chingaza  station  (4  m/s)  correspond  to  category 3 winds, i.e. weak breezes. <a href="#r42">[42]</a>  According to the wind atlas of Colombia, winds higher than 3 m/s generally occur over the mountainous area of
           the central and eastern cordilleras, which corresponds to the area of the Páramo Chingaza station. <a href="#r42">[42]</a>  This corresponds to the study area because it is located in the eastern mountain range of the country.</p>
           
        <p><b>Wind energy analysis: </b>The energy analysis of the municipality consisted of determining the energy density per unit area of the data obtained from the meteorological stations consulted, obtaining power density values in W/m2. These values were then analyzed geostatistically,
              as shown in the following figure.</p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img12.png" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>According to the previous figure, it can be observed that the Páramo Chingaza station shows the highest energetic values of all the three stations, which is positive data for the study area since it is the only station that is inside the study area. It is observed that the highest
           energy supply is found towards the south of the municipality, since this region shows power density values that reach 40 W/m 2.</p>

        <p>The above described corresponds with what is shown by the Nanjing station in Jiangsu province, China shows similar power density values <a href="#r15">[15]</a>as well as the wind atlas of Colombia where it is explained -in a very general way- that the power density values in the Andean region of the
           country oscillate between 8 W/m2and 125 W/m 2. <a href="#r42">[42]</a>  However, according to Amaya, Saavedra and Arango, the values shown by the analyzed stations (Table 6) correspond to wind power class 1 (Poor) because the power density value is below 100 W/m2 . 2<a href="#r25">[25]</a>  Likewise, according to Zhou, 
           Wu and Liu in their corresponding study, this value corresponds to a poor wind resource zone. <a href="#r15">[15]</a> </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img13.png" height="260px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p><b>Determination  and  selection  of  wind  turbines: </b>To  determine  if  the  wind  conditions  of  the  municipality  are  suitable to generate energy, a search for wind turbine models capable of generating energy from the capacities of the municipality was carried out, as 
              mentioned above in section 2.2.9. Using the Windographer program, the following graph  was  obtained  showing  the  power  curves  that  can  generate  some  of  the  turbines  consulted  with  the  energy  conditions shown by the Páramo Chingaza station.</p>
    
        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img14.png" height="330px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>As shown in the figure above, several turbines can take advantage of the wind potential of the municipality of Guasca because they can generate energy with wind speeds of less than 4 m/s, which can be translated as good performance characteristics at low wind speeds, which can be
           useful for energy self-sufficiency at the residential level. <a href="#r44">[44]</a> .</p>

        <p><b>Determination of estimated performance and wind turbine constraints:</b>The following is a description and analysis of the information obtained from the net power generation analysis, as well as the evaluation of the environmental constraints for the study area.</p>

        <p>The  estimated  performance  of  wind  turbines:  When  performing  turbine  performance  analysis,  it  can  be  observed that multiple turbines can take advantage of municipal wind conditions, as shown in section 3.5. Among the analyzed turbines, the models with
           the highest net average output power and net energy (Table 8) are the Endurance G-3120, Eocycle EO 25/12 and Proven 15 models, and their net power output is 4.9 kW, 2.2 kW and 2.3 kW, as shown in Table VII,</p>

            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img16.png" height="330px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p><b>Restrictions to the performance of wind turbines: </b>When analyzing the geographical conditions of the municipality, it was observed that the south of the study area is almost entirely within the Chingaza National Natural Park, that is, the area with the greatest energy supply 
              of the study area is almost entirely within a protected area, which may result in an obstacle to the possible implementation of turbines in the municipality.</p>
        
        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-1/img17.png" height="400px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>Likewise,  when  analyzing  the  humidity  and  temperature  conditions  of  the  study  area,  it  is  observed  that  the  municipality presents temperatures mainly between 6o C and 12o C as well as a relative humidity index that ranges between 80% and 85% in almost all the territory,
           which can be a possible obstacle for energy production.</p>

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            Based on the observations in the two statistical analyses, it can be established that the highest wind speed data are found
            towards the south of the municipality of Guasca, Cundinamarca. According to what was observed in the wind roses and the
            spatial analysis of the data, it is established that the wind flow in the municipality of Guasca comes mainly  from  the
            east  (both  from  the  southeast  as  shown  in  the  data  of  the  stations  Páramo  Chingaza  and  PNN  Chingaza and from
            the northeast as shown in the data of the station PTAR Tocancipá) and crosses the municipality towards the west. The greatest
            energy supply of the municipality of Guasca is located towards the southern region of the municipality, which makes it suitable
            for small-scale energy generation, in aspects such as energy self-sufficiency at  the  residential  level.  However,  the  analysis
            of  environmental  restrictions  shows  that  the  southern  area  of  the  municipality of Guasca is almost completely within the
            territory of the Chingaza National Natural Park, which is an important obstacle for the possible future implementation of wind energy systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            In  any  case,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  existence  of  other  stations  in  the  municipality  of  Guasca  that  had  to  be  
            discarded either because of lack of data or because they did not measure wind speed and direction data indicates that a more detailed study 
            in this municipality or neighboring municipalities could obtain more promising data than the present study for the implementation of wind energy systems in the region.
