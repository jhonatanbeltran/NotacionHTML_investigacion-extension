                    In terms of numerical modeling, one of the aspects that mainly affects the earth pressure values
                    of tie-back excavations is the friction or adhesion that is generated at the interface between the
                    soil and the retention structure material (generally concrete). Typically, software providers based
                    on the finite element method establish that the roughness value does not have a major influence on  
                    the  results.  However,  when  comparing  the  output  data,  in  numerical  simulations,  this  is  
                    not  necessarily entirely true. Generally, this factor is simulated in the programs relating the 
                    interface strength with the soil strength. The current contribution aims to validate the influence 
                    of the variation of different parameters related to roughness or friction on the results of earth 
                    pressure in an anchored diaphragm wall. The results show high variations, with a high dependence on 
                    the mentioned parameters that are related to the modeling of the interface.

        <p class="titulo"> Introduction</p>
                
        <p>
            Numerical modelling is a versatile, economical, and useful technique among the activities that exist for predicting 
            the performance of geotechnical structures. The modeling of mechanical behavior depends on many variables, therefore, 
            it  should  be  reproduced  or  selected  properly  to  make  it  as  realistic  as  possible.  However,  controlling  
            the  response  of  a  geotechnical  structure  that  depends  on  earth  materials  such  as  soil  is  a  complex  task,  
            because  the  soil  is  a  heterogeneous material, with behaviors that can be erratic to some extent and that are governed 
            by different aspects defined by nature. This makes it a difficult material to represent through a physical-mathematical equation 
            immersed in a numerical method, in this case of study, the finite element method (FEM).

        </p>

        <p>
            Depending on the geotechnical problem to be addressed, more or fewer variables can influence the analysis of the final simulation 
            results. In the case of anchored retaining structures supporting deep excavations, a typically passive condition of the containment 
            on the soil is generated, which directly influences the interface between both materials. Considering this position, clearly show us 
            the interaction between concrete and soil defined in the simulation software is a sensitive variable in the results.
        </p>

        <p>
            The  interface  created  by  the  FEM-based  programs  allows  the  production  of  interaction  that  is  generated  between  two 
            materials. The simulation is developed by inserting a theoretical roughness value. Generally, this value acts as a decrease factor, 
            depending on the shear strength of the soil, since the interface is considered to be less resistant and more flexible than the 
            geo-material [1]. It is even possible to use residual reduction factors.
        </p>

        <p>
            Of  course,  the  choice  of  the  reduction  value  is  highly  dependent  on  the  constitutive  model  used  in  the  modeling.  
            In  traditional  constitutive  models  based  on  elastoplasticity,  the  interface  strength  depends  on  the  reduction  factor.  
            However, more complex models, such as Hoek-Brown or modified Cam-Clay, have particularities when correctly assigning this value and 
            deserve more detailed analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
            The simulations proposed in this work are developed on typically anchored excavations, with standard values for the stratigraphy of 
            the terrain. The main objective is to observe the evolution of the results when varying the parameters that influence the roughness 
            between the containment and the soil that simulates the interface between the two materials.
        </p>


        <p class="titulo">Importance of the Soil-Structure Interface Modelling</p>

        <p>
            Not only the interface per se; but the way it’s stimulated by the software and even with the constitutive model used, ends up being an 
            essential factor that strongly influences the final result of the model, although the manufacturers insist that it’s not an aspect that 
            generates major concerns. However, each software takes into account the recommendations to  consider  when  the  interface  is  used  to  
            simulate  some  kind  of  roughness  between  two  surfaces.  In  this  case  the  structure-floor interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
            This interaction must be reproduced by a suitable variable. Without an interface between the structure and the soil, these two materials 
            would move together. This relative displacement which is naturally realistic, some programs call it slipping/gapping; is crucial in modeling 
            between structure and soil in an anchored excavation. By using an interface, even nodes are generated at the interface of the containment and 
            the soil. In this pair node, one of the nodes belongs to the structure and the other to the soil (Figure 1). In conventional modeling, the nodes 
            are simulated by elastoplastic springs that reproduce the vertical and horizontal movement. In other types of more complex constitutive models, 
            these springs adopt the essence of the constitutive law to simulate this behavior <a href="#r2">[2]</a> - <a href="#r7">[7]</a>.
        </p>

        <img class="image" src="img/V26-N1-2/img1.png" height="300px" width="auto">

        <p>
            Already in the 80's of the previous century, when numerical modeling emerged as an important tool for prediction in engineering, it was mentioned 
            that the key aspects in a modeling process are the right choice of the constitutive law and the structure-soil interface <a href="#r8">[8]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Dong <a href="#r9">[9]</a>, highlights the relevance of the behavior of the interface in the global mechanical response of the structu-re-soil system. As mentioned 
            above, one of the classical ways is to consider the interface as a material with a tradi-tional friction model close to Mohr-Coulomb (perfectly 
            plastic elastic). Another alternative is to use the interface as a thin continuous element within the finite element mesh, assigning similar 
            properties to any of the materials involved.
        </p>

        <p>
            In terms of friction values, it has been demonstrated through physical tests, that the structure-soil interface presents lower results than the shear 
            strength of the soil. This was developed by Potyondy <a href="#r10">[10]</a>, varying different aspects such as particle size distribution, humidity, load solicitation, 
            among others. Similarly, Boulon <a href="#r11">[11]</a> and Boulon & Nova <a href="#r12">[12]</a> through direct shear tests proved this response and generated a constitutive law of the 
            studied phenomenon.
        </p>

        <p>
            The above is in the presence of laboratory tests. However, numerically, Powrie & Li <a href="#r13">[13]</a>, Day & Potts <a href="#r14">[14]</a>, <a href="#r15">[15]</a>, have used different techniques to analyze 
            the interface and its importance in numerical simulations. These include assigning a zero stiffness to interface elements and a shear modulus represented by 
            Mohr-Coulomb. Similarly, 2D elements of zero thickness have been used, affected by shear and normal forces that are connected by a problem-spe-cific 
            constitutive law to the normal and tangential deformations of the finite element. However, these ideas present numerical problems such as poor meshing, 
            drawbacks in the convergence of the solution, and critical stresses at the integration points between nodes of the finite element.
        </p>

        <p>
           Nowadays, modern computer programs methods use based on contact surfaces, such as even nodes (Figure 1). The contact can be reproduced by traditional 
           constitutive models. There are even extensions to simulate allowable stres-ses, anisotropy, and friction coefficients.
        </p>

        <p>
            In summary, according to Day & Potts <a href="#r15">[15]</a> and Dong <a href="#r9">[9]</a>, the properties assigned to the interface influence the ground motion  and  deformation  of  
            the  structure.  A  realistic  contact  model  must  be  selected  to  correctly  reproduce  these  effects. Details of the relationship between 
            interface properties and the performance of anchored excavations are spo-radically reported in scientific publications.
        </p>


        <p class="titulo">Computational Model and Methods</p>

        <p>
            A typical model of a deep excavation retained by a diaphragm wall (diaphragm) with a thickness of 60 cm is proposed. The containment is in the passive 
            condition through the installation of pre-stressed anchors. The stratigraphy is composed of different sandy strata that are distinguished by their 
            resistance values, as well as by the thicknesses between them. For this reason, the flow condition will be drained (see Figure 2).
        </p>

        <img class="image" src="img/V26-N1-2/img2.png" height="400px" width="auto">

        <p>
            The constitutive model used is Mohr-Coulomb for all strata and hence for the interface simulation which is calculated according to the soil properties 
            based on the following assumptions, where Rinter is the reduction factor of the interface strength <a href="#r10">[10]</a>, <a href="#r11">[11]</a>, <a href="#r12">[12]</a>, <a href="#r1">[1]</a>:
        </p>

        <img  class="image" src="img/V26-N1-2/img3.png" height="300px" width="auto">

        <p>
           This reduction value should always be assigned according to the recommendations of the software used and taking into account the constitutive model 
           of the soil on which it depends. Anchored retaining structures can have different types  of  interaction  between  the  soil  and  other  materials  
           of  the  retaining  structure,  usually,  concrete  is  the  most  commonly used. So far, the direct influence of the reduction values has not been 
           fully studied. According to this uncertainty, this value was varied between 0.6 and 1.0 taking into account the interaction between sand and concrete 
           analyzed in Table 1, where the recommended values of the reduction factor for modeling the interface, according to the interaction with the material, 
           are shown.
        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-2/img4.png" height="250px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
            In some cases modern software resorts to setting the reduction of the interface value as rigid in places of the modeling close to structural elements, 
            especially in 3D simulations. In the software used in this research, it is appropriate to use Rinter = 1.0 for this eventuality. In this case, the 
            interface will directly inherit the soil properties, including stiffness. The Poisson's ratio will not remain the same, since it depends on other 
            aspects, such as the drainage condition of the geotechnical problem.
        </p>

        <p>
            As already mentioned, the interface interaction is less rigid than the adjacent soil, so this value is always less than 1, as shown in Table 1. 
            When there is high uncertainty of the value or there are materials with unknown interactions, the reduction factor can be associated with a value 
            close to 0.67 <a href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is necessary to explain what physically happens with the interface from the point of view of the constitutive model. In states of elastic 
            stresses, both a motion parallel and perpendicular to the rough contact surface can happen. Motion that is perpendicular to the interface is 
            considered as a separation displacement, as a function of stress and stiffness normal to the surface.  Parallel motion, on the other hand, is 
            simulated as sliding as a function of tangential stress and shear stiffness.
        </p>

        <p>
            These equations must be used with care; because the stiffnesses are inversely proportional to the displacements, which can cause large 
            deformations at the interface or convergence problems in the result if extreme values are used. The selected software states that the 
            key aspect is the virtual thickness of the interface. This value is automatically selected by the program so that the stiffness obtained 
            is adequate.
        </p>

        <p class="titulo">Results and Discussion</p>

        <p>
            This research aims to analyze the possible influence of the choice of the interface value, in an aspect that in the authors' opinion can be 
            quite sensitive in the results of an anchored excavation, in a typically passive condition. This aspect is the earth pressure on the retaining 
            structure. As the anchors are pre-stressed, this implies that the pressure of the containment on the soil increases the interaction between both 
            surfaces, especially near the position of the anchors. This fact makes the interface more sensitive to earth pressure values.
        </p>

        <p>
            Indeed, in Figure 3 a very clear dependence can be observed between the value of the reduction factor to simulate the interaction of the interface 
            and the earth pressure on the concrete retaining structure. It is important to remember that the software recommends values between 0.6 and 1.0. The 
            reduction factor was evaluated in this range.
        </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="img/V26-N1-2/img5.png" height=300px" width="auto">
        </div>

        <p>
            Referring to the presented results, when the value of reduction factor equal to one is chosen, the mechanical behavior of the interface is identical to 
            the soil. As the value is reduced the earth pressure decreases, but following the same qualitative trend.
        </p>

        <p>
            This can be explained physically and according to the theoretical basis already presented, in the fact that the reduction factor makes the interface weaker 
            and more flexible than the soil. Being more flexible, there will be a greater relative displacement perpendicular to the interface. Therefore, the interaction 
            between the two materials will be less strong, which translates into less friction or roughness on the theoretical contact surfaces. This is strongly evidenced 
            in the results presented.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, it is important to note that, in the earth pressure results, it is observed that the first meters present null values in this aspect. 
            The reason for this behavior is that the anchors, being pre-stressed, push the middle part of the containment towards the ground, generating a 
            quite high passive condition. This causes that in the first meters of the containment there is a certain separation between the soil and the 
            structure. This situation also tends to occur in the lower part of the excavation, although there it is more influenced by the embedment of the 
            structure (Figure 4).

        <p class="titulo"> Conclusions</p>
        <p>
            The  methodology  used  to  model  the  interface  is  a  crucial  factor  in  this  type  of  modeling.  It  must  be  taken  into  account
            in detail, not only the value of the reduction factor that simulates the interaction at the interface but also the constitutive model of the 
            surrounding soil and even understands in detail the basically-mathematical basis proposed by the software to simulate the interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            Indeed, the selection of the interface value is directly related to the numerical simulation results of the excavation. The earth pressure on 
            the wall is reduced because the lower reduction factor makes the interface more flexible. This is seen in the results obtained.

            Containment structures typically in a passive condition may be more susceptible to be affected by the modeling of the  interface.  This  passive  
            condition  is  generated  by  the  presence  of  pre-stressed  anchors  that  decrease  the  virtual  thickness of the interface, producing a 
            stronger interaction between the two materials involved.

            This  is  also  evident  in  the  places  of  the  retaining  structure  that  are  far  from  the  anchorages.  At  these  points  the  soil tends 
            to move away from the structure, increasing the thickness of the interface and reducing its stiffness, thus reducing the earth pressure value.
